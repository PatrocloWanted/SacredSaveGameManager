# Sacred Save Game Manager - Improvement Suggestions

## Project Analysis Summary
The Sacred Save Game Manager is a Tkinter-based GUI application that manages save game directories for "Sacred Gold" using a clever symlink-based approach. While functional, the codebase would benefit from significant refactoring and improvements.

## 1. Code Architecture & Organization

### High Priority
- [x] Split the monolithic `App` class (~600+ lines) into smaller, focused classes:
  - [x] `GameManager` - Handle game directory operations
  - [x] `SaveManager` - Manage save directory operations  
  - [x] `UIManager` - Handle UI components and interactions
  - [x] `ConfigManager` - Manage configuration loading/saving
- [x] Create proper package structure with separate modules:
  - [x] `models/` - Data structures and business logic
  - [x] `views/` - UI components (package structure created)
  - [x] `controllers/` - Application logic
  - [x] `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
- [x] Separate file operations, validation logic, and UI code into different modules
- [x] Implement proper dependency injection for better testability

### Medium Priority

  - [ ] MyPy for type checking
  - [ ] Pre-commit hooks

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add performance tests for large save collections
- [ ] Implement automated UI testing
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up continuous integration

## 6. Dependencies & Build System

### High Priority
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies (Pygments and rich are not used in main.py)
- [ ] Fix setup.py entry point (currently references non-existent `main:main`)
- [ ] Add proper dependency management with version constraints
- [ ] Update to use modern build tools (Poetry or setuptools-scm)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add development dependencies section
- [ ] Create requirements-dev.txt for development tools
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates

## 7. Features & Functionality

### High Priority
- [ ] Add save game preview/metadata display:
  - [ ] Show save date/time
  - [ ] Display character information if available
  - [ ] Show save file size
- [ ] Implement proper save game backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Add search and filtering for large save collections

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Support for multiple game versions or mods
- [ ] Add import/export functionality for save collections
- [ ] Implement save game comparison features
- [ ] Add automatic save organization by date/character
- [ ] Support for save game thumbnails/screenshots

## 8. Performance & Scalability

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large save directory lists
- [ ] Add background validation of game directories
- [ ] Implement caching for expensive file system operations
- [ ] Add async operations for non-blocking UI updates
- [ ] Optimize UI rendering for large lists

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add database backend option for large collections
- [ ] Implement save game indexing for faster searches
- [ ] Add memory usage optimization

## 9. Documentation & Maintenance

- [ ] Sanitize user input for file names
- [ ] Add integrity checks for symlinks

## 12. Bug Fixes

### High Priority

- [ ] Handle the case where config.json becomes corrupted
- [ ] Fix potential race conditions in file operations

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve error handling when Sacred.exe is not found
- [ ] Handle cases where symlinks point to non-existent directories

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Critical)
1. Fix existing bugs
2. Add basic error handling and logging
3. Split monolithic class into smaller components
4. Add unit tests for core functionality

### Phase 2 (Important)
1. Improve UI with keyboard shortcuts and better UX
2. Add configuration validation and migration
3. Implement proper dependency management
4. Add comprehensive documentation

### Phase 3 (Enhancement)
1. Add advanced features (save previews, search, etc.)
2. Implement performance optimizations
3. Add cross-platform testing and optimization
4. Create comprehensive user documentation

## Notes
- The current symlink-based approach is clever and should be preserved
- Consider backward compatibility when making changes
- Test thoroughly on all target platforms before releases
- Prioritize user experience improvements alongside code quality
